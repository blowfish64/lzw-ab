This is an implementation of the Lempel-Ziv-Welch general-purpose data
compression algorithm. It is targeted at embedded applications that require
high speed compression or decompression facilities where lots of RAM for
large dictionaries might not be available. I have used this in several
projects for storing compressed firmware images, and once I even coded the
decompressor in Z-80 assembly language for speed! Depending on the maximum
symbol size selected, the implementation can require from 1024 to 261120
bytes of RAM for decoding (and about half again more for encoding).

The symbols are stored in "adjusted binary" which provides somewhat better
compression (with virtually no speed penalty) compared to the fixed word
sizes normally used. To ensure good performance on data with varying
characteristics (like executable images) the encoder resets as soon as the
dictionary is full. Also, worst-case performance is limited to about 8%
inflation by catching poor performance and forcing an early reset before
longer symbols are sent.

LZW-AB consists of three standard C files (the library, a command-line
demo using pipes, and a command-line test harness) and builds with a single
command on most platforms. It has been designed with maximum portability
in mind and should work correctly on big-endian as well as little-endian
machines.
